# MinecraftApi
This project aims to develop a REST API around Minecraft RCON allowing Minecraft servers to manage and run commands using a REST API on their Minecraft Server.

# State

This project started on 01/06/2022. So it's extremely fresh. For now all the code is doing the RCON implementation.

After that we will implement the API allowing remote commands through an API.
